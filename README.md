# Coding 3: Data Management and Analysis with Python 2021/22 Winter

In this project, we chose the dataset via Kaggle on UK Car Accidents 2005-2015, link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/silicon99/dft-accident-data). 
### Context
UK police forces collect data on every vehicle collision in the uk on a form called Stats19. Data from this form ends up at the DfT and is published at https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data. There are 3 CSVs in this set. Accidents is the primary one and has references by Accident_Index to the casualties and vehicles tables.
